# pepper-api

an unofficial, arguably crappy, creatively-constructed rust wrapper for various chipotle APIs.

data sourced from this crate is used to power burritobot.

## implemented functionality

- get all locations in the US (ID + ZIP code)
- get menu for a location by ID

## trivially implementable but missing functionality

- more location data

## things that would be cool but aren't easy

- ordering(?)
